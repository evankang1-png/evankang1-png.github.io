        History
    </strong>
    <p>
        2021
        <br>
        Seesaw Communities was founded during the COVID-19
        <br>
        pandemic with the belief that adults with developmental
        <br>
        disabilites, like the peers, should have the opportunity to
        <br>
        engage in meaningful work and contribute to society. In May
        <br>
        2021, Seesaw Communities launched its Coffee Education
        <br>
        program, provding hands-on trainging to help participants
        <br>
        develop job-ready skills.
    </p>

    <p>
        2022
        <br>
        Seesaw introduced its Graphic Art program, empowering
        <br>
        participants to devlop digital and creative skills. The program
        <br>
        aims to help them design and create their own products, offering
        <br>
        job opportunites by selling on platforms like Etsy. The Espresso
        <br>
        Cart program was launched to raise community awareness
        <br>
        about individuals with developmental disabilities while providing
        <br>
        them with real-world job experience through events like
        <br>
        corporate functions and golf tournaments. Seesaw held 27
        <br>
        Espresso Cart events in 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
       2023
       <br>
       Seesaw's Espresso Cart program expanded, with 57 events held
       <br>
       across corporate functions, golf tournaments, and community
       <br>
       gatherings. In August 2023, Seesaw Beans and Coffee was
       <br>
       opened in Buena Park, facing the difficulty of finding
       <br>
       employment for individuals with developmental disabilities in
       <br>
       regular stores. All students who completed Seesaw's training
       <br>
       were hired as staff. 
    </p>

    <p>
        2024
        <br>
        In February 2024, Seesaw launched the Walnut Coffee Training
        <br>
        Center in the East LA area, providing individuals with
        <br>
        developmental disabilities not only weekly practice in a real-
        <br>
        world cafe setting but also valuable training opportunities. Also
        <br>
        in Feburary 2024, a former Seesaw Beans and Coffee staff 
        <br>
        member, along with their parents, opened an on-site cafe at
        <br>
        San Gabriel Pomona Regional Center, making their transition to
        <br>
        independent business ownership. In August 2024,
        <br>
        Seesaw introduced a Baking Program to complement its coffee training,
        <br>
        recognizing the importance of bakery skills in running a
        <br>
        sucessful cafe. To support our growing barista traing program,
        <br>
        we plan to open 2nd and 3rd locations, which will also
        <br>
        include bakery services. These new spaces will provide more
        <br>
        hands-on training opportunities, helping trainees devlop both
        <br>
        coffee-making and baking skills. This expansion will further
        <br>
        strengthen our mission to enpower individuals with
        <br>
        developmental disabilites by providing a supportive
        <br>
        environment for vocational training and community engagement.
