        training, employment opportunities, and a sense of

        esteem, and a better quality of life for individuals with
        <br>
        developmental disabilities by equipping them with the skills

        <p>
            We envision a world where individuals with developmental
            <br>
            disabilities are fully integrated into society, not just as workers
            <br>
            but as valued members of their communities. Seesaw

            Communities seeks to break down barriers, raise awareness,
            <br>

        History
    </strong>
    <p>
        2021
        <br>
        Seesaw Communities was founded during the COVID-19
        <br>
        pandemic with the belief that adults with developmental
        <br>
        disabilites, like the peers, should have the opportunity to
        <br>
        engage in meaningful work and contribute to society. In May
        <br>
        2021, Seesaw Communities launched its Coffee Education
        <br>
        program, provding hands-on trainging to help participants
        <br>
        develop job-ready skills.
    </p>

    <p>
        2022
        <br>
        Seesaw introduced its Graphic Art program, empowering
        <br>
        participants to devlop digital and creative skills. The program
        <br>
        aims to help them design and create their own products, offering
        <br>
        job opportunites by selling on platforms like Etsy. The Espresso
        <br>
        Cart program was launched to raise community awareness
        <br>
        about individuals with developmental disabilities while providing
        <br>
        them with real-world job experience through events like
        <br>
        corporate functions and golf tournaments. Seesaw held 27
        <br>
        Espresso Cart events in 2022.
    </p>

    <p>
       2023
       <br>
       Seesaw's Espresso Cart program expanded, with 57 events held
       <br>
       across corporate functions, golf tournaments, and community
       <br>
       gatherings. In August 2023, Seesaw Beans and Coffee was
       <br>
       opened in Buena Park, facing the difficulty of finding
       <br>
       employment for individuals with developmental disabilities in
       <br>
       regular stores. All students who completed Seesaw's training
       <br>
       were hired as staff.
